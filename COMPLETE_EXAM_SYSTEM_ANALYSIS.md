# Complete Secure Exam Space System Analysis & Fixes

## Project Overview

The **Secure Exam Space** is a comprehensive online examination platform designed to ensure academic integrity through continuous monitoring, anti-cheating measures, and structured candidate workflows.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Key Libraries**: React Router, React Hook Form, Zod validation, Sonner toasts

## **System Architecture**

### **Database Schema**
```
exams (exam management)
├── exam_sections (MCQ, Theoretical, Practical)
│   └── exam_questions (questions with options/answers)
├── candidate_sessions (candidate registration & progress)
└── candidate_answers (submitted responses)
```

### **User Flows**

#### **Admin Flow**
1. **Authentication** → Admin Dashboard
2. **Create Exam** → Define sections and questions
3. **Manage Exams** → Monitor sessions and results
4. **View Sessions** → Review recordings and answers

#### **Candidate Flow** (FIXED)
1. **Registration** → Personal details + consent
2. **Permission Setup** → Camera/Mic/Screen sharing (MANDATORY)
3. **Exam Taking** → Three sections with timers
4. **Submission** → Answers + recording saved

## **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **1. Candidate Registration Issues** ✅ FIXED

**Root Cause**: RLS policies were too restrictive for anonymous users
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive RLS policies allowing anonymous registration
- Added proper permissions for `anon` role
- Enhanced validation functions

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250121000003_complete_candidate_fix.sql` (NEW)
- `src/pages/CandidateRegister.tsx` (ENHANCED)

### **2. Exam Flow Issues** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Recording was optional, no automatic exam start
**Root Cause**: Missing enforcement mechanisms
**Solution**:

- Added automatic permission request flow
- Implemented exam start enforcement

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/CandidateExam.tsx` (ENHANCED)
- `src/components/VideoRecorder.tsx` (ENHANCED)

### **3. Supervision Features** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: No automatic camera/mic/screen sharing activation
